### Transcript
[Music] [Applause] hi welcome to another video So Anthropic launched their claude code and it was quite cool It was almost like Ader but more and more focused on the Anthropic Claude models and stuff like that I used it and it was actually amazing and keeps getting updates that make it even better Although it's not technically open source which means that you can't change it to use some other model or anything like that But now we have a new repo called Gemini code and it's actually by an ex Google employee who was one of the founding developers of Notebook LM which is a really great product for sure It is made from scratch and is open source as well as fully free to use It has drawn most of its inspiration from Claude code They say that it is an AI powered coding assistant that brings the capabilities of Google's Gemini 2.5 Pro directly to your terminal It is a simple and easy to use command line experience similar to Claude Code and has all the features that you generally see in things like Claude Code or even Ader It uses the new Gemini 2.5 Pro as the main model and the rate limits are now much more open for it which is kind of great And it also has a fallback to Gemini 1.5 Pro if a series of errors happens which is fine Although I would have liked to see an option to configure other providers and use those for the other tasks as well Since it's based on Gemini the context window is pretty big at 1 million tokens which is kind of great It supports and allows you to use different types of models within the Gemini ecosystem which means that it includes multiple model support It also has basic history management which allows you to prevent excessive context length It does not have any kind of smart context management like clawed code and is pretty basic in that sense And it also does not seem to have proper tree sitter and such capabilities in code indexing that you get with claude code In tools it has the file operations tool directory operations tool system commands which means that it can run terminal commands for installing packages and stuff like that And it can also view the linting and formatting errors as well It also has testing and such capabilities as well which is kind of great Let me show you how you can use it and let's see how well it works in practice But before we do that let me tell you about Ninja Chat Ninja is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month you get access to top AI models like GPT40 Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash all in one place I've been using Gemini for quick research but what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side by side Their mind map generator is a gamecher for organizing complex ideas as well The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages 30 images and five videos monthly with higher tiers available if you need more Use my code king 25 for 25% off any plan or king 40 yearly for 40% off annual subscriptions Check the link in description to try it yourself Now back to the video First of all to install it you can just run the pip install Gemini code command and it will get Gemini code installed for you Then you'll need to navigate to the project folder you want to use it in And then to set up your API key you'll need to run the Gemini command along with the setup flag and then provide your API key and it will get the API key set up for you accordingly Now we can start it on our project with the Gemini command But before we do that let me just quickly show you some of the config setups with it So first if you hit the A2 flag then it will show you the other flags that you can use and there are two There's the list models option and there's also the set default model The list models if we run it here will list all the models available on the Gemini API And then you can set the default model to use with the set default model And then Gemini code will use that model for most of the tasks which is great If you just want to start one session with a different model then you can also start Gemini with the model flag and then enter the model name Anyway now if we start it then you can see that it's now started And this is what it looks like It's very similar to clawed code but it doesn't have some stuff like the slash commands It has only two commands which are exit and help Anyway now you can see which model has been initialized with and we can now give it our prompt and it will just do that for you So I have a basic folder here with no content I'm going to ask it to set up a next.js app for me and then create a good-look image cropper tool This is a good prompt because it requires setting up next.js Then it needs to write code that is hard as you need to handle canvas and it's a pain for many models that I have seen So let's see It has the animations that are also very similar to claude code which is fine although it doesn't stream the code And it doesn't ask you for approval when it runs terminal commands which can be bad in some cases for sure I don't know why it does that but it does it So there's that Anyway we have the diff review here Let's just approve this Okay it's now done If we run this then the app is good Although it doesn't have the download image option which is obviously needed So let's ask it to add that and make it better Once we send it you'll see that it starts working on it It again does all the stuff in the same fashion So if we wait a bit then it's now done And we can now look at it And it does indeed have the option and it works fine So I like it I really like this generation because the generation is very to the point and fast Like you don't get icons or anything which is what I like It's to the point You get the upload option and then we get the image here which we can crop easily here and then just download it has no distractions which is a sign of a good generation because you might see that sometimes you get a generation with a bunch of features that you actually never wanted So the generations are good Although now if we talk about the coder itself then there are some issues with it for sure Like the terminal commands are executed without asking The diff view is pretty lackluster The up and down arrow doesn't work to bring up the old prompts and it lacks a lot of features like it doesn't have a very good knowing of what's going on If Claude Code or Ader is a 10 then this is probably a three but I like the direction in which it is going As the developer has stated that this is a weekend project then it's really good I would obviously like for it to improve and become actually better similar to Claude Code Claude Code is actually a lot more fleshed out for sure So I hope that this also follows the same trajectory and becomes a go-to Gemini coding thing You can go ahead and give this a try and use it for sure Overall it's pretty cool Anyway share your thoughts below and
