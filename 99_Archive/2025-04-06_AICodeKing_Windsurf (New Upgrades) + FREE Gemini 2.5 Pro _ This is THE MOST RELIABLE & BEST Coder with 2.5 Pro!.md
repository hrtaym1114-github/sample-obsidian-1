### Transcript
[Music] [Applause] hi welcome to another video Gemini 2.5 Pro is everywhere and rightfully so it's a really great model option for people to use it's supremely good at coding and can reason through even challenging tasks which is awesome to say the least it ranks at the top of aer's leaderboards which means a lot for a model from Google and in my own testing it's really impressive but there's a problem it's still experimental which means even if you want to pay for it you can't which is unfortunate due to this limitation it's heavily rate limited and can become unusable when multiple people are using it simultaneously so that's a major problem although Google has updated the rate limits of the Gemini 2.5 Pro for users with payment method added although you still won't be charged and it has also been made available on vertex which means that Gemini 2.5 Pro is even more reliable now in the ways that I'm going to show you next and that's with windsurf windsurf has recently added the Gemini 2.5 pro model and it works quite well there although the wind surf team mentions you may occasionally hit limits it it's still insanely more reliable than the Gemini API which is really unstable the API doesn't even work half the time this is why wind surf's integration is great they've just launched their wave 5 update and added Gemini 2.5 Pro which is the most reliable way to use it without any model overloading issues that I've encountered so far that's why I wanted to talk about this as I plan to cover the wave 5 updates in this video as well I also got access to GPT 4.5 in it and thought I'd discuss that too now let me first tell you about wave five and then we'll move on to how you can use Gemini 2.5 Pro with it wave 5 isn't actually a massive update it's pretty simple and small but it makes a huge difference in practice in wave five they've essentially combined all the context of your wind surf experience into one unified system now multiple Tab Key options like autocomplete and tab to jump share one context and they've renamed the whole experience wind surf tab this means if you ask it to do something in Cascade even in autocomplete it will take that information into context and give you suggestions based on that shared knowledge so if you're building a specific app it will understand what you're trying to do and provide better customized suggestions they say that windsurf tab cohesively captures the fine grained Global set of actions leading to some emergent behavior that no other solution on the market can currently achieve it can even incorporate context from your terminal and based on that data show you relevant suggestions you can use can also take into consideration what you have in your clipboard this means if you copy a code snippet or documentation it will include that in its context and give you suggestions accordingly which is really amazing it's almost as if it already knows what you want to do before you ask which is definitely impressive it can also remember what you've discussed in Cascade and incorporate that context as well that's essentially what you'll see in wave 5 but now let's jump in and let me show you how this works along with the new Gemini 2.5 Pro and GPT 4.5 models but before we do that let me tell you about ninja tools ninja tools is an AI platform that combines all the best AI models and experiences at one place it allows you to save over $600 per year compared to having separate subscriptions you get access to Claude 3.7 Sonet GPT 40 Gemini and a ton of others models in one subscription you even get some more cool options like AI video Generation image generation music generation and document chats you can also use their playground to compare multiple AI responses at once the best part is that it just starts from $11 per month that gives you more than 1,000 chat messages 30 AI image generation and five music generation while there is also some even more advanced plans if you need them also make sure to use my coupon code AI code king2 to get an additional 20% off make sure to check ninja tools out and save some money on your subscription while you're at it now back to the video first of all make sure that you upgrade to the latest version once done let me show you how the new tab experience works if we go to the settings here you'll see that everything is categorized under the wind surf tab option which is cool and you can configure things there so for example if I go to this file and set the model to use as something specific and then go to the terminal and just print it and now if I go here and create a model name variable it will automatically bring that context in which is pretty cool it's basically aware of everything that's happening around your workspace if you have something in your clipboard it can reference that or if you disc discuss something in Cascade it can reference that too which is really useful in real world work scenarios so that's great next we have the Gemini 2.5 pro model here as well this will be available to everyone even if you're on the free tier there's a free one-time trial gift on download which includes about 50 premium model user prompt and 200 premium model flow action credits enough for you to try it out anyway here you can see the Gemini 2.5 pro model and it actually works amazingly well it does sometimes error out because 2.5 Pro is heavily rate limited but windsurf has worked with Google to secure better rate limits and it works quite well I find it much more reliable than the original API and it actually works consistently so you can definitely use this with confidence plus it's fantastic to use with the preview option because it allows you to literally Vibe code as the kids say these days let's try something with it as a demonstration I'm going to ask it to build me a three.js game where I can drive a car on a road Gemini is particularly great at this kind of task which is amazing as we do that you'll see it start working and if we we wait a bit now it's done and we also have the preview open here you can see that it handled this task really well and it only took about three prompts from a user perspective which is quite impressive Claude would have probably taken longer to do the same thing and this result is very usable I can obviously use this code and ask for specific changes as needed which is also great that's mostly what I wanted to cover I also have GPT 4.5 here which is only rolled out to some users I got access and it doesn't cost any credits if you receive it which is nice however I've used it and found it to be quite disappointing I don't really understand what this model is trying to achieve and I never use it so there's that I really like the Gemini model and as soon as the rate limits improve I'll probably fully switch to Gemini 2.5 Pro also I recommend using CLA Sonet and winds surf for most tasks and only using Gemini 2.5 Pro when you encounter something Sonet can't handle this way you won't keep hitting rate limit errors and other issues I also wanted to mention some of the mCP servers that I've been using first of all you can see my Gemini 2.5 Pro Manus alternative video where I have used serper and the fetch mCP tool I really use this because it makes windsurf better than Manis for me and it's free which is kind of great windsurf also have the search capabilities built in but I don't use that as much that's majorly the mCP servers that I use you can also use the browser base mCP server and have even better and more cohesive results than Manus that's pretty much everything about it I really like it and Gemini 2.5 Pro is truly an impressive model to experience overall it's pretty cool anyway share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel you can also donate via super thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks I'll see you in the next video bye [Music]
