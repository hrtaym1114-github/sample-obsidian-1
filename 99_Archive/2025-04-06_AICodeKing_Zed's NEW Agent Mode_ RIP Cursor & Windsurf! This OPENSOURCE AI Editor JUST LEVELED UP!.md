### Transcript
[Music] [Applause] hi welcome to another video So Zed is something I've been covering for a while now It's one of the editors that has built-in AI features It's not a fork It was made from scratch with AI in mind and it isn't just an abstraction layer over VS Code which is already super heavy If you don't know about Zed it's an open- source editor made by the creators of Atom Atom was an editor I used quite a lot when it first came out but then I switched to VS Code partly due to society and peer pressure But anyway the same developers went ahead and made Zed It's actually an editor I was using until AI extensions like Klein started popping up Those weren't supported in Zed and it almost became necessary for me to use VS Code as most AI tools were only compatible there Zed is an editor built from scratch using Rust It consumes less memory and is super fast with rendering at around 120 fps which is kind of insane for an editor But anyway they weren't behind on AI features They added Z AI features to their editor which were really good when they first came out It allowed you to use inline assist It had a chat panel You could send it a file to work on and apply changes and multiple other things like that But by today's standards it became a bit outdated rather quickly We now want agentic capabilities to uh vibe code as the kids say these days This means we want to just give it a prompt and have it figure out the rest like which files to read or write and so on similar to Klein or Windsurf However they are now working on an agent mode which is almost a complete overhaul of the entire AI system Yes Zed is now developing its own agentic editing features They were kind enough to give me early access and you can also sign up for their weight list to likely get access pretty soon too Also they seem to be iterating rapidly so you'll likely see it improve over time When it becomes generally available I can do another video then But anyway let me show you the new Zagentic mode that I've gained access to But before we do that let me tell you about Ninja Chat Ninja is an all-in-one AI platform where for just $11 per month you get access to top AI models like GPT40 Claude 3.7 Sonnet and Gemini 2.0 Flash all in one place I've been using Gemini for quick research But what's really cool is their AI playground where you can compare responses from different models side by side Their mind map generator is a gamecher for organizing complex ideas as well The basic plan gives you 1,000 messages 30 images and five videos monthly with higher tiers available If you need more use my code king 25 for 25% off any plan or king 40 yearly for 40% off annual subscriptions Check the link in description to try it yourself Now back to the video So if you get access you can just download the Z preview version Then if you open the assistant panel you'll see this new UI It looks pretty good Let me guide you through it First you can type your prompt here You can also attach context manually if you want You can add a file or give it a URL to fetch documentation or other information which is really great Another thing that you'll see is the option to use profiles Profiles are really great and quite simple to use What they do is pretty effective You get two profiles by default One is the code writer and the other is the read only option Now what makes each profile different are the tools you allow it to use Zed has a bunch of built-in tools and you can configure whether each profile has access to them or not For example the readonly profile only has options like viewing diagnostics fetching content listing directories basically all readonly tasks The writing tools are disabled for this profile while the main editor profile has access to all tools You can also create your own profile by going into the settings and adding an element like this one Currently you configure the tools within this settings file but they are working on a graphical option for this so you won't need to edit the file directly in the future Anyway this is really amazing as it allows you to keep things controlled using custom profiles Apart from this you can select the model that you want to use You get $10 of credit with Zed initially which you can use You can also top it up at the same rate that anthropic or open rotor charges but you can also set up a lama models deepseek anthropic Gemini and Mistral as well This is amazing as you're not stuck just paying zed You can use whatever model you want including the free tier of Gemini which is great Now since we're in the settings you can see we also have the MCP server option here This is pretty cool as you can easily add MCP servers here It also has a marketplace-l like feature for MCP servers similar to Klein which allows you to instantly add them although it's a bit limited right now Anyway let's go back now and try using it to see how well it performs So let's start with something simple I have this blank folder and I want Zed to initialize a next.js app and then create a simple image cropper tool for me Let's see how it does First it gives me the option to run a command to initialize the next.js project Once we approve that you'll see it starts working It then goes ahead and creates the necessary files and structures accordingly which is pretty cool And it's now done And it handled all of this pretty well Although one thing I've noticed is that it doesn't show things like streaming the response which is kind of a downside but it's currently in alpha stages And I hope this gets added because it feels good to see the code being streamed live So I hope we get that Now it currently works primarily with git for version control So what we can do is open the diff view here to see the code it generated or changed Then we can also stage the changes and commit them right from here I like this approach because I use git for most tasks But if you don't they also seem to be working on a non-git option too So that's great You can also view the changed files in the git panel Now let me show you the app that it built Once we run it you can see it's finished And this looks pretty cool I really like how it looks and it works really well So this is quite amazing It's pretty awesome for sure Their new Agentic system actually works really well The main difference I've noticed is that it's much snappier than tools like windsurf or cursor It also doesn't consume as much memory as VS Code Having AI integrated from the ground up is amazing You can see the difference Like when a request completes you instantly see the response appear It would be even cooler if it streamed though I really like this and probably as soon as it gets more fleshed out I'll switch to it The pricing is transparent it's open source it's snappy and you can use your own API keys or even local models It's literally what I've always wanted in an editor It's not a fork It comes with a bunch of features and they're only getting started Achieving this level of quality already is just insane to see Overall it's pretty cool Anyway share your thoughts below and subscribe to the channel You can also donate via superth thanks option or join the channel as well and get some perks I'll see you in the next video Bye [Music]
